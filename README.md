# Cloud Infrastructure Management & Operations - Docker & Containerization Assignments - Week 4

Welcome to the repository for my cloud infrastructure management and operations assignments, focusing on Microsoft Azure and now, deep diving into Containerization with Docker. This project demonstrates practical skills in deploying, securing, monitoring, and managing resources within the Azure cloud environment, and extending into robust container orchestration practices. Each task within this repository addresses key aspects of cloud administration, from fundamental identity and access management to advanced virtual machine operations, security policies, and secret management, now including efficient container workflows.

The assignments cover a range of core Azure services and demonstrate proficiency in using both the Azure Portal and command-line tools (Azure CLI and PowerShell) for effective cloud resource orchestration, alongside practical Docker implementations.
